This case is an extension of the [Elastic tube 3D](https://precice.org/tutorials-elastic-tube-3d.html) case of the official preCICE tutorials. In order to run it, you need to copy the [`fluid-openfoam`](https://github.com/precice/tutorials/tree/master/elastic-tube-3d/fluid-openfoam) case files into this directory. Afterwards, open the `./system/preciceDict` file and change the entry `writeData` from `DisplacementDelta` to `Displacement` and the entry `readData` from `Force` to `Stress`. Furthermore, you might need to copy the `polyMesh.orig` directory containing the mesh information, i.e., `cp -r constant/polyMesh.orig constant/polyMesh`. The default directory name was changed as the OpenFOAM cleaning functions remove the `polyMesh` directory by default and the mesh was not generated using `blockMesh`. Next, you can start the fluid participant as usual, e.g. using `pimpleFoam` for serial execution.
